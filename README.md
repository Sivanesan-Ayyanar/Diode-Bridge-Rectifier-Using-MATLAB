## Getting Started

### Requirements

To run these Simulink models, you need:

- MATLAB with Simulink installed (preferably R2021a or later).

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB.
3. Navigate to the cloned repository folder.
4. Open the Simulink model files:
    - `single_phase_diode_bridge_ectifier.slx` for the single-phase rectifier.
    - `threephase_diode_bridge_rectifier.slx` for the three-phase rectifier.
5. Run the simulations to observe the rectification process.

## Model Details

### Single-Phase Diode Bridge Rectifier

The single-phase diode bridge rectifier model demonstrates the rectification of a single-phase AC input into a pulsating DC output. This model includes:
- AC voltage source.
- Four diodes arranged in a bridge configuration.
- Load resistor.
- Visualization of input and output waveforms.

### Three-Phase Diode Bridge Rectifier

The three-phase diode bridge rectifier model demonstrates the rectification of a three-phase AC input into a smoother DC output compared to the single-phase rectifier. This model includes:
- Three-phase AC voltage source.
- Six diodes arranged in a bridge configuration.
- Load resistor.
- Visualization of input and output waveforms.
